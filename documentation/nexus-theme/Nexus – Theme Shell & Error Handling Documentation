# NEXUS – Theme Shell & Error Handling

## Purpose

This document describes the **Nexus Shell theme** used as a neutral, institutional presentation layer for WordPress while the NEXUS plugin remains the system authority.

The goal is to:

* Provide a clean, professional UX for non-existent pages (404)
* Avoid WordPress default messaging and branding
* Keep strict separation of responsibilities (theme vs plugin)

---

## Core Principles

1. **WordPress is a container**
2. **NEXUS plugin owns all logic and decisions**
3. **Theme is presentation-only**
4. **No business logic in the theme**
5. **No redirects decided by the theme**

The theme must be replaceable at any time without breaking NEXUS.

## Current Scope (v1.1.0)

### Implemented

* Custom institutional 404 page
* Fully responsive layout
* Centered card (desktop + mobile)
* Original SVG illustration (no external assets)
* Forced stylesheet loading to avoid WordPress edge cases

### Explicitly NOT Implemented

* Redirects
* 500 error handling logic
* Maintenance mode
* Auth / permission logic
* Plugin integration

## Styling Strategy

### Why CSS Is Forced

WordPress may not automatically enqueue `style.css` under certain conditions.
To guarantee consistency:

* `style.css` is explicitly enqueued in `functions.php`
* Cache-busting is handled via `filemtime()`

This ensures the theme behaves consistently across:

* Admin / non-admin users
* Staging environments
* Temporary domains

---

## 404 Page Behavior

* HTTP status code: **404**
* No automatic redirects
* Clear, neutral messaging
* User-controlled actions only

  * Go back (browser history)
  * Home (/)

The theme **does not decide** whether a page should redirect.

---

## Console Warnings (Expected)

### Permissions-Policy Warnings

These originate from hosting or proxy layers (e.g. temporary domains).
They do **not** affect:

* Theme rendering
* CSS loading
* NEXUS behavior

They are safe to ignore during development.

---

## When to Extend This Theme

Future extensions may include:

* `500.php` (visual only)
* Maintenance templates
* Shared layout patterns

Any logic determining **when** to show these must live in the NEXUS plugin.

---

## Final Notes

This theme is intentionally minimal.

Its purpose is to:

* Remove noise
* Provide a professional baseline
* Stay out of the way of system logic

All intelligence belongs to NEXUS.
